Thanks for taking a look at my project portfolio! I put this repository together as a central place to share some of the work I’m most excited about, mainly across FPGA development, digital design, and computer architecture. Each folder represents a different project, and inside you’ll find the source code along with notes and documentation that explain the design choices and implementation in more detail.

If anything catches your interest or you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me at mats7629@gmail.com. I’m always happy to talk more about these projects. Thanks again for taking the time to check this out!

Best,<br>
Stephen Mathew
